# GIPHY_API


This project collects gifs from the API gify.com and displays them to the user. Users can also search for their favorite subjects and relevent gifs are returned.

The GIPHY_API can quickly find gifs and determine their ratings. This is useful for researching new trends in technology and society. 

Users can start with the preloaded buttons that return gif images of selected topics. They can customize buttons of their own choosing by entering topics that interest them in the empty field.

This project is maintained by Herbie Molina.
